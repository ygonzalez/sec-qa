The **10-K** is an annual report filed by companies to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
It provides a comprehensive summary of a company's performance and includes details such as its organizational structure, financial statements, 
earnings per share, and benefits plans. This document can also cover a company's history, 
equity, holdings, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data.

Sample questions you can ask about a 10-K include:
- Can you provide a detailed overview of [company]'s core business operations, including its main products or services and target markets?
- What competitive advantages does [company] have in its industry?
- Are there any pending or ongoing legal proceedings that could result in financial liabilities or damage to [company]'s reputation?
- What are the current industry and market conditions, and how do they impact [company]'s growth potential?
- Who are [company]'s major competitors, and how does it differentiate itself in the market?
